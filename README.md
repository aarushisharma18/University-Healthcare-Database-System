### Introduction:
The University Healthcare Database is a web-based application designed to streamline healthcare data management for universities across the United States. This system aims to address critical issues in the healthcare industry, such as affordability, timely care, and accessibility of patient information. It offers a user-friendly interface for students, healthcare providers, insurance companies, and medical professionals.



### Model Objective:
The primary objective of this database system is to provide efficient, organized, and secure healthcare data management for universities. It allows students to fill out health history forms, which are stored securely. It enables healthcare providers to access student data based on location and zip code, facilitating prompt medical attention and vaccinations. The system also helps universities and healthcare providers manage inventory, appointments, and check-ups effectively.



### Challenges Addressed:
1. **Data Organization**: The system organizes and manages healthcare data, addressing the challenges posed by manual record-keeping.
2. **Security**: Robust security measures ensure data privacy and prevent unauthorized access.
3. **Accessibility**: The system ensures patient information is accessible to authorized healthcare professionals and institutions.
4. **Efficiency**: It streamlines healthcare operations, reducing administrative costs and ensuring timely care.



### Model Documentation:
The University Healthcare Database is built on MySQL and MongoDB and includes ten tables, such as Student, University, HealthcareProvider, etc. The EER and UML diagrams were developed to model the database, and SQL queries were created for data retrieval. Python was used for connection with the SQL database for data visualization. This system promotes open science, responsible data exchange, and public health improvement in the USA, with customization options for future enhancements.
